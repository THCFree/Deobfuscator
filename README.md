## âœ… How to run deobfuscator
If you want to use this deobfuscator, you need to start it from your IDE manually.

1. Place your obfuscated jar inside the root project directory. For example in `work/obf-test.jar`
2. Navigate to class [`Bootstrap.java`](./deobfuscator-impl/src/test/java/Bootstrap.java)
3. In this class edit the deobfuscator configuration
    - `inputJar` - Your obfuscated jar file that you placed in step 1
    - `transformers` - Pick transformers that you want to run. You can find them in [`deobfuscator-transformers`](./deobfuscator-transformers/src/main/java/uwu/narumi/deobfuscator/core/other) module.
4. Run this class manually from your IDE. You can use our pre-configured IntelliJ task named `Bootstrap`.
